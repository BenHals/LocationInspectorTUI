# Location Inspector
_Mainly a learning exercise for Rust!_

<WORK IN PROGRESS>

This is a TUI application written in rust which displays information about geographic location in the terminal.

For example, we may have a backend with a list of cities each with:
- A location in the world
- A set of points or areas of interest in local space (suburbs, train stations etc.)
- Some timeseries information (weather, population, etc.)
- Static metadata (Name, Country, etc)

The aim to to provide a nice visual way to quickly look up this data for a given location, as well as compare locations.
